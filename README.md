# 🦜 LangChain V1 Mastery & GenAI Chatbot

This repository documents my implementation of **LangChain Version 1 (V1)** core concepts and the development of a production-ready Q&A Chatbot. While the curriculum suggests OpenAI, this project is powered by the **Groq API** for high-speed inference and **Ollama** for local open-source model integration.

## 🛠️ Section 1: LangChain V1 Core Updates
Detailed implementation of the latest V1 framework features:

* **Agentic Workflows:** Creating intelligent agents that utilize tools to solve complex tasks.
* **LLM Integration:** Seamlessly connecting the **Groq API** and open-source models.
* **Execution Patterns:** Implementing Invoking, Batching, and Streaming for real-time AI responses.
* **Structured Outputs:** Ensuring machine-readable data using **Pydantic**, **TypeDict**, and Python **Data Classes**.
* **Advanced Middleware:**
    * **Message Types:** Managing System, Human, and AI message states.
    * **Summarization:** Automatic conversation compression.
    * **Human-In-The-Loop:** Integrating manual approval steps into AI workflows.

## 🤖 Section 2: End-to-End Q&A Chatbot
A full-stack Generative AI application built with a focus on performance and accessibility:

* **Brain:** Powered by **Groq API** (Llama 3/Mixtral) for lightning-fast reasoning.
* **Interface:** A sleek, interactive web app built using **Streamlit**.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Custom prompt templates designed for high-accuracy Q&A.
* **Local Alternative:** Optional integration with **Ollama** to run open-source models locally.
